    <h1> What is the F Layout?</h1>

    <p>
        The F layout for web design focuses on the natural instinct of web browsers/surfers.
        In other words, this type of layout is based on research and eye tracking
        studies of where the particular eye of a user goes to first when on
        a website

        </p>
    <p><img src= "images/heatmap.jpg" style="float:left" /><div style="clear:both"></div>
    </p>

    <h2>How Does The Design Work?</h2>
    <p>
        The user will start at the top-left side of the screen.
        Then, they will then scan towards the right to the top-right side of the screen.
        After, they will  move down and read the next row of content in full all the way to the pageâ€™s sidebar.
